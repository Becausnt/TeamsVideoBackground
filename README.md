Note: Sadly doesn't work for images

## Short version:
1. Open the folder "%localappdata%\Packages\MSTeams_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Microsoft\MSTeams\Backgrounds"
2. Replace "feelingDreamy2Animated_v=0.1.mp4" with your own video. (Note: Your video has to be named "feelingDreamy2Animated_v=0.1.mp4")
3. Open teams, activate your camera and select the below Background:

## Long Version
### 1. Download your Video
Download the video you want as a background and save it to a location you remember.

### 2. The folder
Path to the folder: "%localappdata%\Packages\MSTeams_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Microsoft\MSTeams\Backgrounds"
Inside this folder you'll find a video called "feelingDreamy2Animated_v=0.1.mp4". Rename this to something like "feelingDreamy2Animated_v=0.1_original.mp4" if you want to keep it, otherwise you can just delete it.

### 3. Adding your video
Move your video to the folder we opened in step two and rename it to "feelingDreamy2Animated_v=0.1.mp4".

### 4. Selecting your video in a call
In your call, activate your camera and select "Background Filters"

Note that the thumbnail for your custom video will still be the default one, but select it anyway.

Now you should be able to see your video running in the preview window.
